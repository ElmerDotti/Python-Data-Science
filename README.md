# Copper price forecast

This is an open source project aims at making a prediction of copper price using machine learning / deep learning approach. The language of this project is Python and the ideas may extend to other time series prediction problems as you like.

# Motivation

The motivation of launching this project is that copper is a kind of important raw material of some midstream and downstream materials, whose price is of great relevance to copper price. Thus a high accuracy of copper price prediction can to some extent providing purchasing decisions for the purchasing agent.

Here is a comparison of the fluctuation of the price of cooper and a kind of downstream material:

# Structure
- [common](https://github.com/liyinwei/copper_price_forecast/tree/master/common): common method such as data loading, model evaluation & model visualization etc.
- [mlp](https://github.com/liyinwei/copper_price_forecast/tree/master/mlp): predict copper price using sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor
- [lstm](https://github.com/liyinwei/copper_price_forecast/tree/master/lstm): predict copper price using keras.layers.recurrent.LSTM
- [pcb](https://github.com/liyinwei/copper_price_forecast/tree/master/pcb): correlation analysis of copper and a downstream material price

# Data
You can visit the [spiders project](https://github.com/liyinwei/spiders) and run [shfe](https://github.com/liyinwei/spiders/tree/master/shfe) to crawling copper future price from [Shanghai Futures Exchange](http://www.shfe.com.cn/).

# Running
There is a main method in each python file so you can run it easily.

the following is a sample of predict result of the [mlp](https://github.com/liyinwei/copper_price_forecast/tree/master/mlp) method:
